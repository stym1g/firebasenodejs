"# firebasenodejs" 
You have to install required modules to run the project
Check code of app.js file
If you want to run the project first nodejs and npm should be installed on your system after that
install following modules by using npm install command
firebase, firebase-tools, nodemailer
I have used nodemailer to send the mail to user.
Goto https://sampleproject-657b2.firebaseio.com/userinformation.json and
https://sampleproject-657b2.firebaseio.com/users.json
